\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:concl}
We presented new streaming algorithms for $k$-means clustering.  Compared to
prior methods, our algorithms significantly speedup query processing, while
offering provable guarantees on accuracy and memory cost.  The general framework
of ``coreset caching'' may be applicable to other streaming algorithms built
around the Bentley-Saxe decomposition.  For instance, applying it to streaming
$k$-median seems natural. Many other open questions remain, including
(1)~improved handling of concept drift, through the use of time-decaying
weights, and (2)~clustering on distributed and parallel streams.
